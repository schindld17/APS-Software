This software is the program used to control the APS during operation. It is meant to be built within the 
Texas Instruments (TI) Code Composer Studio IDE. THe software was developed and intended for use with
the TI F28377xS Delfino MCU or the C2000 LaunchPad XL TMS320F28377s. To build and flash this code to the
proper MCU read the instructions within the Arctic Power System Software Creation Procedures within the CML. 
Included with this code archive should be a .xls file which contains the pin-out diagram used with this code. 
This diagram is intended to be used with a PTP (176-pin) package.

This code can also be found backed up on the APS-Software repository https://github.com/schindld17/APS-Software
The repository is currently set to only allow edits from authorized contributors. Contact original author to for
this to be changed or to be added as an authorized contributor.

All code was developed for use with the Actic Power System project at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
